# Undergrad
Some of the Jupyter Notebooks from my time as undergraduate student in Physics at Constructor University Bremen (formerly known as Jacobs University Bremen).
Remark: Notebooks for Project 1 and 2 from the course Modeling of Earth System Data are templates I have filled out. I did not fully write them.
